The repository contains the code to enable the SEV support on AMD Eypc Processor.

Prepare Hypervisor:
===================
Follow the below steps to prepare the host OS (hypervisor) for SEV support:

# cd /home/user/
# git clone https://github.com/AMDESE/AMDSEV.git
# cd AMDSEV
# ./build.sh  (this should take a while, it will build the linux kernel, qemu and ovmf)

The script is designed to produce a kernel debain packages. Install the new kernel
image as shown below:

# cd /home/user/AMDSEV/output/kernel/
# sudo dpkg -i linux-image-*.deb

Reboot the host OS and select the "-sev" image from the grub menu.

On successful boot, verify that /dev/sev1 device is created.

Prepare guest OS
=================
Follow the below steps to update your guest image with SEV kernel. The step assumes you
have a working guest image. In below steps we will boot the guest and update the kernel
image to use our kernel.

1) Launch a guest (non sev)
 # cd /home/user/AMDSEV/output/qemu-output
 # sudo ./launch-qmeu.sh -nosev -hda <your disk image>

NOTE: The launch scripts are setup to use UEFI based guest BIOS image (aka OVMF), it is
assumed that your hard disk image was installed using UEFI based guest BIOS.

2) Login to the guest and copy the linux-image-*deb created during host prepration.

3) Install the kernel image using "dpkg -i linux-image-*.deb"

4) Shutdown the guest


Launching SEV Guest
===================

To launch SEV enabled guest, use:

# cd /home/user/AMDSEV/output/qemu-output
# sudo ./launch-qemu.sh -hda <your disk image>


NOTE: when guest is booting, CTRL-C is mapped to CTRL-], use CTRL-] to stop the guest
